## Benefits and limitations of using Functions as a Service (FaaS) in both Azure and GCP
### Azure Benefits
- Azure supports a variety of programming languages which is good depending on what your preference is.
- Azure is based off a consumption based model so depending on the type of project you're working on, it is a good tool to use because you can choose how much you want to spend and how much memory storage you need.
- Azure is also great for monitoring healthcare data in the sense that you can set up automated workflows for scheduling or record processing.
### Azure Limitations
- Azure Functions have a time limit on how long they can run so if you have a long project or a time consuming project it may not be the best to use for those types of projects.

### GCP Benefits
- Cloud functions allows you to use popular programming languages like Python or Javascript and is highly compatible with other cloud services which makes it easier to use amongst those related platforms.
- Similar to Azure, GCP is based off how much time and memory usage you need which is great for smaller projects given that they offer a free option.
- GCP also offers AI tools that can be used to manage or analyze healthcare data.
### GCP Limitations
- GCP Functions also has a time limit in its run time given that it can only run for 9 minutes.

### Takeaway From Azure And GCP
- Azure is great if you are already comfortable with using their tools and intend to use Microsoft services.
- Azure allows for more progamming lanugage to be used compared to Google Cloud Functions.
- Azure allows for easy deployment of hybrid set ups across different environments.
- GCP is great if you are already comfortable with using Google services or if your business is already highly integrated with their services.
- GCP can be more cost effective if you are using it for smaller projects given that they offer a free tier.
- GCP has integrated AI tools if needed.
- GCP also requires less configuration than Azure, so it is great for microservices.
